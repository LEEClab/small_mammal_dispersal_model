# GRASS GIS landscape database

This is a sample database of 29 simulated neutral landscapes created using the software [QRULE](https://www.umces.edu/qrule) and loaded into 
a database in [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org) environment. The folder also contains Python scripts for changing the resolution
of these maps, creating the scenarios with the different landscape elements, and exporting these maps in the ASCII format.
