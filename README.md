# Individual-based model for modeling small mammal dispersal

This is a repository for sharing an individual-based model developed for simulating the dispersal patterns of small mammals with specific perceptual range and movement parameters across heterogeneous landscapes. This model was developed in The NetLogo environment.

# Usage

This repository is organized as it follows.
- [code](https://github.com/LEEClab/small_mammal_dispersal_model/tree/master/code): Here you find the main NetLogo code to run the model. 
- [landscapes](https://github.com/LEEClab/small_mammal_dispersal_model/tree/master/landscapes): Here you find the landscape files used in the model. 
- [landscapes_GRASS_GISdb](https://github.com/LEEClab/small_mammal_dispersal_model/tree/master/landscapes_GRASS_GISdb): Here you find the scripts to export the landscape files from simulated landscapes in GRASS GISS.
