# Landscapes 

This repository contain all the simulated landscape files used on this model. 
 
- These landscapes are composed of four elements: habitat patches (> 5 hectares), small patches used as stepping stones (< 5 hectares), scattered trees used as stepping stones (< 20m2 - 2 cells), and pasture. We generated four different landscape scenarios, as following: 
    - Only habitat patches - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_PATCHES_ONLY
    - Habitat patches and Stepping stones - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_NO_TREES
    - Habitat patches and Scattered trees - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_NO_SS
    - Habitat patches, Stepping Stones, and Scattered trees - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_ALL_TREES_2P_SS_5HA_PATCH
- Layer files with distance of each point of the matrix to the near landscape elements (habitat patches, small patches and scattered trees)  
    - Distance from Habitat patches - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_PATCHES_ONLY_DIST
    - Distance from Stepping stones - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_SS_5HA_DIST
    - Distance from Scattered trees - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_2PIX_TREES_DIST
- Layer files of identification (ID) of all landscape elements (habitat patches, small patches and scattered trees) 
    - ID of Habitat patches - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_PATCHES_ONLY_PID
    - ID of Stepping stones - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_SS_5HA_PID 
    - ID of Scattered trees - Exported_ascii_MS_HABMAT_2PIX_TREES_PID
